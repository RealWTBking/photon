Photon is a client-side modpack that dramatically improves performance on Minecraft 1.7.10-1.21.11 across Fabric, Forge, NeoForge, and Quilt. Photon is deliberately built with simplicity and compatibility in mind. As a result, Photon can be used as a framework for building larger, content-focused modpacks.
